			Hello World! My name is Maryam and I recently became a web developer. After a short
			career in teaching, I decided to change paths and became interested in web development.
			I spent four months learning about coding at the AFCI institute in Villeneuve d'Ascq.
			These past months have ascertained my desire to become a web developer. Now that I've
			introduced myself, feel free to have a look at my portfolio and contact me if you are
			interested in my work! <br />
			<br />
			Enjoy!
